# TelcoAI Challenge: AI-Driven Power Optimization

## Overview
This project is an MVP developed for TelcoAI to optimize power usage across telecom sites using AI. It adheres to a pixel-perfect implementation of the provided Figma design and employs a modular, clean code approach. The solution utilizes Recharts for data visualization and shadcn/ui for consistent design, ensuring adherence to best practices.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Recharts

## Features
- Modular component architecture with clean code principles.
- Task assessment with multiple interactive elements.
- Optimized for screens with a resolution of 1440x900, as specified in the Figma file.
- TypeScript for enhanced static type-checking and maintainability.
- Recharts integration for data visualization.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (or yarn) package manager

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artfull-boy/TelcoAI_Challenge.git
   cd telcoai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Steps to Build the Project
1. **Build the production version**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Development Approach
- **Design Implementation**: Followed a pixel-perfect approach to match the Figma design.
- **Modular Components**: Created reusable components where necessary. Some components are not reused, as their functionality was specific to a single use case.
- **Responsive Design**: Focused on the target resolution of 1440x900 for consistency with design requirements.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Used TypeScript for improved type safety and code maintainability.

## Key Libraries and Tools
- **Recharts**: Used for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations.
- **shadcn/ui**: Ensured consistent UI elements and adherence to the design system.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Applied scalable and maintainable styles effectively.


### Timeline
